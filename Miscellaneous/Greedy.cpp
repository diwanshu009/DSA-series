/* Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of 
  finding a global optimum solution. In these algorithms, decisions are made based on the information available at the 
  current moment without considering the consequences of these decisions in the future. The key idea is to select the
  best possible choice at each step, leading to a solution that may not always be the most optimal but is often good 
  enough for many problems.
